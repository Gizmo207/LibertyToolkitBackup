    principle: "Banning apps isn't protecting freedom — it's censorship in disguise.",
    myth: "Banning TikTok keeps us safe from foreign disinformation.",
    fact: "Censorship doesn't stop propaganda — it just sets a precedent for banning platforms that carry views politicians dislike.",
    rebuttal: "If the government can ban TikTok today, what stops them from banning X, or any app conservatives rely on, tomorrow?",
    fastFact: "Montana passed a statewide TikTok ban in 2023, but courts struck it down as unconstitutional before it took effect.",
    tpusaTieIn: "Free societies don't ban apps — they trust citizens to make their own choices.",
    corePrinciples: {
      primaryPosition: "Government app bans violate the First Amendment and set dangerous precedents for future censorship.",
      talkingPoints: [
        "When government picks winners and losers in the marketplace of ideas, we all lose.",
        "The Constitution doesn't have a 'Chinese exception' to the First Amendment.",
        "Today it's TikTok, tomorrow it's any platform that challenges government narratives.",
        "150 million Americans chose TikTok. Who is Congress to override their decision?",
        "We defeat bad ideas with better ideas, not with bans.",
        "Censorship is the tool of weak arguments and authoritarian governments.",
        "The marketplace of ideas works when government stays out of it.",
        "Liberty means having the freedom to make choices politicians disagree with.",
        "You can't protect freedom by destroying it.",
        "If the government can silence foreign voices today, they'll silence domestic ones tomorrow."
      ],
      whyItMatters: "This isn't just about one app - it's about whether we trust citizens to make informed choices or surrender that authority to government bureaucrats. Free societies counter bad speech with more speech, not censorship."

    title: "Social Media Censorship",
    category: "Free Speech",
    principle: "Free speech protections must extend into the digital public square.",
    myth: "Tech companies are private, so they can censor anything they want.",
    fact: "When platforms act like utilities, silencing speech amounts to viewpoint discrimination.",
    rebuttal: "Imagine if your phone carrier dropped your call because they didn't like your politics. That's what Big Tech censorship feels like.",
    fastFact: "Twitter Files (2022) revealed government agencies pressured platforms to silence certain viewpoints.",
    tpusaTieIn: "TPUSA believes students must defend free expression online as strongly as on campus.",
    corePrinciples: {
      primaryPosition: "Digital platforms have become the modern public square and must respect free speech principles.",
      talkingPoints: [
        "The First Amendment doesn't stop at the keyboard - digital speech is real speech.",
        "When Big Tech acts as a utility, it has a duty to serve all viewpoints equally.",
        "Government pressure on platforms is just censorship by proxy.",
        "Viewpoint discrimination online is as unconstitutional as discrimination offline.",
        "Students have the right to express conservative views without algorithmic suppression.",
        "Free speech means protecting unpopular opinions, especially on controversial topics.",
        "Social media companies aren't neutral platforms when they systematically silence one side.",
        "The solution to bad speech isn't less speech, but more diverse viewpoints."
      ],
      whyItMatters: "College campuses and social media are where young people form their worldviews. When conservative voices are systematically silenced, it creates an echo chamber that prevents intellectual diversity and genuine debate."

    id: "campus-speech-codes",
    title: "Campus Speech Codes",
    category: "Free Speech",
    principle: "Universities should be marketplaces of ideas, not echo chambers.",
    myth: "Speech codes make campuses safer and more inclusive.",
    fact: "Most speech codes have been struck down in federal court as unconstitutional.",
    rebuttal: "Shielding students from offensive speech doesn't prepare them for the real world — it infantilizes them.",
    fastFact: "As of 2023, FIRE reports 88% of colleges maintain restrictive speech policies.",
    tpusaTieIn: "TPUSA exists to push back on biased administrators and reclaim free debate on campus.",
    corePrinciples: {
      primaryPosition: "University speech codes violate the First Amendment and undermine the educational mission of higher learning.",
      talkingPoints: [
        "The First Amendment was written specifically to protect unpopular and offensive speech.",
        "Speech codes don't make campuses safer - they make them less intellectually honest.",
        "Students who never encounter challenging ideas graduate unprepared for the real world.",
        "Universities that restrict speech become echo chambers, not centers of learning.",
        "Free speech is how we test our ideas and discover truth through rigorous debate.",
        "Conservative students have the right to express their views without fear of administrative retaliation.",
        "Speech codes often disproportionately target conservative viewpoints under the guise of 'hate speech'.",
        "True inclusivity means including all viewpoints, not just approved ones."
      ],
      whyItMatters: "College is where students should learn to think critically and engage with diverse perspectives. Speech codes prevent this intellectual development and create graduates who can't handle real-world disagreement."

    title: "Antisemitism Speech Laws",
    category: "Free Speech",
    principle: "Even hateful speech is protected unless it directly incites violence.",
    myth: "Banning antisemitic speech protects Jewish students.",
    fact: "Suppressing ugly ideas drives them underground — it doesn't eliminate them.",

    tpusaTieIn: "TPUSA stands for liberty even when it's uncomfortable — because without it, no one's rights are safe.",
    corePrinciples: {
      primaryPosition: "The First Amendment protects all speech, including hateful speech, unless it directly incites imminent violence.",
      talkingPoints: [
        "The Supreme Court has consistently ruled that offensive speech is protected speech.",
        "Banning speech doesn't eliminate prejudice - it just drives it underground.",
        "Jewish students are best protected by free speech, not by government censorship.",
        "The same laws that protect Nazis' right to march also protect civil rights activists' right to protest.",
        "We defeat antisemitism through education and counter-speech, not through bans.",
        "University administrators aren't qualified to determine what constitutes 'hate speech'.",
        "Speech codes create a chilling effect that silences legitimate debate on important issues.",
        "True tolerance means protecting speech we disagree with, not just speech we approve of."
      ],
      whyItMatters: "The principle that even hateful speech is protected ensures that government can't use accusations of 'hate' to silence political opponents. This protects all minority viewpoints, including conservative ones on campus."
